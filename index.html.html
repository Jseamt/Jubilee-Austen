                    <h2>A little about me</h2>

                    <div class="half-width">  
                        <p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family.
                            My journey into tech started with a degree in jounalism. As I started sharing
                            my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was
                            hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.
                        </p>                                                                                                  
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">  
                        <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to
                            build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &
                            versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end
                            development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean,
                            elegant code.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>

                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formated,semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure
                            that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>

                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my
                            CSS lean and fast to load, and make it a habit to stay up to date on current best
                            practices.            
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ease Converting Design into Code</h3>
                        
                        <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accuratrly convert it into a 
                            webpage that is pixel-perfect match.                   
                        </p>
